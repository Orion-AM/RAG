# Experimental RAG Workspace

This workspace contains multiple experimental projects exploring Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Agentic patterns using LangChain.

## Projects

### 1. [legal-rag](./legal-rag)

A RAG application tailored for legal document retrieval and analysis. capable of ingesting PDF documents and answering questions based on them.

### 2. [ecommerce-analyzer](./ecommerce-analyzer)

A tool designed to analyze e-commerce data, likely involving product reviews or catalog search using RAG techniques.

### 3. [multi-source-agent](./multi-source-agent)

_Development in progress_
An autonomous agent designed to route queries to appropriate data sources or APIs, demonstrating agentic behavior beyond simple RAG.
